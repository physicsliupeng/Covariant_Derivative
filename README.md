# Covariant_Derivative

Covariant derivaitve is a pacakge I wrote for general relativty covariant derivation manipuations.

In general relativty, a covariant derivative could take many steps depending on the order of the tensors the derivaitive acts on. In order to make it automatic in computation, we need to set up certain rules.
